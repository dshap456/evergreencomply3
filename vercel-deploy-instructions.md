# Direct Vercel CLI Deployment Instructions

Since the GitHub integration isn't working properly, let's deploy directly from your local machine using Vercel CLI.

## Steps:

1. **Install Vercel CLI** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. **Navigate to your project root**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/davidshapiro/Desktop/next-supabase-saas-kit-turbo
   ```

3. **Deploy with Vercel CLI**:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

4. **When prompted**:
   - Set up and deploy: **Y**
   - Which scope: Select your account
   - Link to existing project? **Y** (select evergreencomply3)
   - What's your project's root directory? **apps/web**
   - Override settings? **N**

5. **The CLI will**:
   - Detect it's a Next.js app
   - Build it properly
   - Deploy it correctly

This bypasses the GitHub integration issues and deploys directly from your machine where we know the build works locally.

## Alternative: Create a New Vercel Project

If the above doesn't work, try:

```bash
vercel --prod --force
```

And create a NEW project instead of linking to the existing one. This will give you a fresh deployment without any cached settings.
