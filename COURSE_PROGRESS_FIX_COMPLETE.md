# Course Progress Fix - Complete Solution ✅

## Problem Identified
Course progress was not being saved when users navigated away from the course player. The course would reset to the first lesson when users returned.

## Root Causes Found
1. **Unreliable save on unmount**: Used `navigator.sendBeacon` which fails silently
2. **No persistent course position**: Relied on timestamps in lesson_progress table instead of dedicated field
3. **Infrequent saves**: Only saved on component unmount, not on lesson changes
4. **Fragile restoration**: Complex logic to find last accessed lesson from timestamps

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Changes
Added dedicated fields to `course_enrollments` table:
- `current_lesson_id`: Tracks the current/last accessed lesson
- `current_lesson_language`: Tracks the language version being viewed

**To apply: Run the SQL in `fix-course-progress.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor**

### 2. API Updates
- **`/api/lessons/update-progress`**: Now updates enrollment's current_lesson_id
- **`/api/lessons/last-accessed`**: First checks enrollment's current_lesson_id before falling back to timestamps

### 3. Frontend Improvements
- **Auto-save on lesson change**: Saves immediately when user selects a new lesson
- **Reliable save mechanism**: Uses regular fetch with keepalive instead of sendBeacon
- **Fallback strategy**: If fetch fails on unmount, falls back to sendBeacon
- **Removed duplicate saves**: Eliminated redundant save calls in navigation handlers

## Files Modified
1. `/apps/web/app/api/lessons/update-progress/route.ts` - Added enrollment update
2. `/apps/web/app/api/lessons/last-accessed/route.ts` - Check enrollment first
3. `/apps/web/app/home/(user)/courses/[courseId]/_components/course-viewer-client.tsx` - Auto-save logic
4. `/supabase/migrations/20250905_add_current_lesson_tracking.sql` - Database migration
5. `/fix-course-progress.sql` - Direct SQL to apply fix

## How It Works Now
1. When user selects a lesson → Immediately saved to `course_enrollments.current_lesson_id`
2. When user navigates away → Final save attempt with keepalive fetch
3. When user returns → Instantly restores from `course_enrollments.current_lesson_id`
4. Language switches → Tracked separately, progress preserved per language

## Testing the Fix
1. Apply the SQL migration (run `fix-course-progress.sql` in Supabase)
2. Deploy the updated code
3. Test by:
   - Opening a course
   - Navigating to lesson 3 or 4
   - Navigating away (close tab, go to dashboard, etc.)
   - Return to the course
   - Should resume at the exact lesson you left

## Benefits
- ✅ **Instant restoration** - No complex queries needed
- ✅ **Reliable saves** - Multiple save points, not just on unmount
- ✅ **Language-aware** - Tracks progress per language
- ✅ **Simple & elegant** - One source of truth for course position
- ✅ **Backward compatible** - Falls back to timestamp method if needed
