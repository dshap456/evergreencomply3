Course Invitation Bug Fix Test
==========================================

PROBLEM FIXED:
When a Team Manager sends a course invitation to themselves (same email),
they couldn't accept it. The error was "invite not found or expired".

ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:

1. ❌ BUG #1: Non-existent table reference
   - File: /apps/web/app/auth/callback/route.ts
   - The code tried to query 'invitations' table which doesn't exist
   - FIXED: Removed the check for non-existent team invitations table

2. ❌ BUG #2: Authentication redirect issue  
   - Files: /apps/web/app/auth/sign-up/page.tsx and sign-in/page.tsx
   - When authenticated users clicked invite link, token was lost
   - FIXED: Added redirect logic to preserve invite token for authenticated users

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:

1. ✅ Fixed auth callback to not check non-existent 'invitations' table
2. ✅ Added authenticated user check in sign-up page
3. ✅ Added authenticated user check in sign-in page
4. ✅ Redirects authenticated users directly to callback with token preserved

TEST FLOW:
1. Team Manager creates invitation (email sent with /auth/sign-up?invite_token=XXX)
2. Team Manager clicks link while authenticated
3. Sign-up page detects authenticated user with invite_token
4. Redirects to /auth/callback?invite_token=XXX
5. Callback processes the course invitation
6. User is enrolled in the course

VERIFICATION:
The testbrittnay@gmail.com invitation should now work correctly.
Token: 6bd1a310-3e2f-4b36-a8a3-e753150bcc3b
