# Contact Form Fix Documentation

## Issue Summary
The contact form was showing an error message due to a Next.js server action registration issue.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Backend Status**: âœ… Working correctly
   - Resend API is properly configured
   - Environment variables are set correctly:
     - `RESEND_API_KEY`: Set and valid
     - `CONTACT_EMAIL`: support@evergreencomply.com
     - `EMAIL_SENDER`: delivered@resend.dev
   - Emails are being sent successfully to the configured email

2. **Frontend Issue**: Server action was not being found by Next.js ("Failed to find Server Action")
   - This was due to how Next.js registers server actions with the enhanceAction wrapper

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Server Action (`apps/web/app/contact/_lib/server/server-actions.ts`)
- Changed to use the correct `from` email address from environment variable
- Improved error handling with specific error messages
- Now returns a structured response with success status and email ID

### 2. Enhanced Contact Form Component (`apps/web/app/contact/_components/contact-form.tsx`)
- Changed to use API route instead of direct server action call (workaround)
- Added detailed console logging for debugging
- Form now resets after successful submission
- Better error logging in the browser console

### 3. Created API Route (`apps/web/app/api/contact-form-submit/route.ts`)
- Handles form submission and calls the server action
- Provides a stable endpoint for the form to submit to

### 4. Improved Email Service (`apps/web/lib/email/resend.ts`)
- Added proper TypeScript return type
- Added validation for RESEND_API_KEY
- Better error handling for edge cases

## Testing the Fix

1. **Run the test script**:
   ```bash
   ./test-contact-form.sh
   ```

2. **Manual Testing**:
   - Visit http://localhost:3000/contact
   - Fill out the form with test data
   - Submit the form
   - Check for the success message
   - Verify email receipt at david.alan.shapiro@gmail.com

3. **Debug if needed**:
   - Open browser console (F12) before submitting
   - Check server logs: `tail -f /tmp/nextjs-dev.log | grep -i contact`
   - Use the debug endpoint: http://localhost:3000/api/debug-contact

## Important Notes

- The system uses `delivered@resend.dev` as the sender (this is a Resend test email)
- To use a custom domain email, you need to verify the domain in Resend dashboard
- The contact emails are sent to: david.alan.shapiro@gmail.com
- Rate limits may apply based on your Resend plan

## Environment Variables Required

```env
RESEND_API_KEY=re_LvFGeSEx_LAsahXDmyaMchcYSmtRJxpjp
CONTACT_EMAIL=david.alan.shapiro@gmail.com
EMAIL_SENDER=delivered@resend.dev
MAILER_PROVIDER=resend
```

## Troubleshooting

If you still see errors:

1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Restart the development server
3. Check browser console for specific error messages
4. Verify environment variables are loaded: `http://localhost:3000/api/debug-contact`
5. Check Resend dashboard for email logs and any delivery issues

The contact form should now work correctly. Emails will be sent successfully and users will see a success message after submission.
